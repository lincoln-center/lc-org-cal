# Lincoln Center Calendar Explorations

## What is this?

An initial design and development exploration of a responsive calendar for lincolncenter.org.

Displays one week in expanded form which can be navigated by clicking on the other weeks in desktop view or by using a pager in mobile view.

A 7 column desktop grid breaks down to a list view on mobile and removes all unnecessary elements such as the non-active weeks and the 'null' days at the beginning of each calendar. 

## Build Notes

* Fonts.com/MAMP: use domain: lc-org-cal.dev
